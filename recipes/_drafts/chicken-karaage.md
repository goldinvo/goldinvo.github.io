japanese book:
- chicken thigh chunks
- soy sauce
- sake
- sugar
- crushed garlic
- beaten egg
1. marinade chicken thighs
2. coat chicken in flour
3. fry 
Comments:
The chicken pieces developed a surprisingly nice 
craggly coating. Interested to see what it would
be like to up the crispyness by doing a flour-egg-flour
dredge. Marinade contributed to a nice flavor but it
lacked some oomph. I really want to have a savory punch.
