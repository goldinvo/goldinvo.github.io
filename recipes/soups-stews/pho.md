<!-- endstub -->

<u>For the broth:</u>
- 2 onions, 1 hand of ginger (bruise). Well-charred and rinsed of blackened bits.
- Beef bones e.g. leg bones, preferably with marrow
- Meats:
    - 
- Spices (whole, toasted), in order of importance:
    - 5 star anise
    - 6 cloves
    - 1 stick cinnamon
    - Black cardamom
    - coriander seeds
    - fennel seeds
- Salt, rock sugar, fish sauce

<u>For the bowls:</u>
- Rice noodles (buy in refrigerated section), soaked/parboiled. 
- Thinly sliced raw beef (easier to slice when slightly frozen)
- Meat/tendons from broth, and any additions (beef ball, tripe, etc)
- Sliced white onion, scallions
- On the side: bean sprouts, thai basil, culantro, lime, hoisin/sriracha etc.


To remove impurities, bring bones and broth meat covered in water to a vigorous boil for a couple minutes. Dump water and rinse bones/meat clean. Simmer everything for about 5 hours. Take the partially simmered meats out after 1½ hours and refrigerate covered under cold water to prevent drying out.

Strain broth and pick out meat. Simmer broth and reduce/dilute as necessary.
