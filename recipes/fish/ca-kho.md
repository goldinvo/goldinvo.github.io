This sweet, salty, and intensely savory Vietnamese-style braised capelin is
one of my childhood favorites<!--more-->. For me, the best part was always the sac of roe 
in each fish, which I would sometimes pick out and save to eat separately.

## Recipe: 
1. Marinade **capelin** in **fish sauce**, **sugar**, **black pepper**, **scallion whites**, **garlic** and **thai chili** on a plate. Could also add MSG.

2. Melt **yellow rock sugar** in **oil** until you have an even, deep brown layer of caramel. This gives the dish a rich brown color. I do this in a small dutch oven.

3. Add the fish and rest of marinade, and braise. Initially cover it to develop flavor and make the fish release liquid, and then reduce uncovered until saucy.

4. Garnish with **scallion greens**, and serve with rice.

## Tidbits:
- Traditionally, you would make this in a clay pot. I don't think it makes a difference
 though in taste though. After cooking, transfer into a clay pot to serve if desired.    
- One of the main characteristics of this Vietnamese method of braising *(kho)*
is the use of *nước màu*, which is caramel dissolved in water, to make the 
food dark brown. I opt to make caramel each time I make these dishes, but you 
could instead make a batch ahead of time (just make caramel and pour water to stop cooking). 
If you do this, then you can start the dish by frying the aromatics such as garlic, scallions, and chilis
in oil instead of adding it to the marinade, and then add nước màu. If you use a clay
pot, this is the easier method since it is hard to make caramel in that pot.
