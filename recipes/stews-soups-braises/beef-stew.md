title: Beef Stew

<!-- stub -->
Classic beef stew. Beef braised in thickened stock with carrots, potatoes, and onion.
<!-- endstub -->


- Beef, seared, in chunks. Use cuts with lots of connective tissue eg. chuck roast
- Flour, for thickening (toss beef chunks in this)
- Carrots, potato, onion, maybe peas (added at end)
- Dry red wine to deglaze, stock
- Additions: tomato paste, worcestershire sauce, vinegar, bay, thyme, etc.

In a low oven (~300F) braise for more than an hour. Then add veggies and potatoes 
and continue to braise until almost desired tenderness (~1hr). Finish by reducing on stovetop. 

Tidbits:
- Can sear beef as steaks first to reduce water loss/overcooking, then cut 
into cubes
- There is a compromise between adding vegetables early to flavor the broth, and
adding later to maintain texture.

## Example [(Kenji)](https://www.seriouseats.com/all-american-beef-stew-recipe):
- 3 pounds **beef** chuck roast, seasoned, seared as steaks then cut into large 
chunks, tossed in 2 Tbsp **flour**
- 10 oz white button **mushrooms**, 2 **carrots**, 8 oz pearl **onions**, as the stew veggies (**peas**, also)
- Halved **onion**, 2 small ribs **celery**, 2 **carrots**, 3 cloves **garlic**, all unpeeled/left whole
- 1 cup sherry/dry vermouth **red wine**
- 4 cups **chicken stock** blended smooth with 3 T **tomato paste**, 3 **anchovy fillets**,
1 T **soy sauce**, 1 T **worcestershire sauce**, and 1 oz (4 packets) **gelatin** for 
smooth, flavorful broth imitating the thickness of a veal stock
- 2 **bay leaves**, 4 sprigs **thyme**
- 1 pound Yukon gold **potatoes**, to avoid extra starchiness (flour and gelatine should be enough for thickening)

This recipe has vegetables that are braised from the beginning to add flavor, which is removed
before adding the vegetables left in the final stew.  

Sear the beef, remove from pot, then saute the stew veggies, then remove from pot, then
blacken the broth veggies. Deglaze with red wine, reduce, and add stock.  

Use this to braise the beef (add bay leaves and thyme) in a 300F oven for 90 minutes.
Fish out everything except the beef, and add the sauted veggies and potatoes. Continue 
braising for upwards of an hour until everything is tender. Reduce. Season and add peas.
