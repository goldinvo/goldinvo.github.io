Whisk egg yolks and lemon juice in a double boiler until thickening. Gradually
pour in melted butter, whisking constantly. Avoid breaking the sauce. Adjust
consistency and taste with lemon juice, water, salt, and cayenne.

***

Traditionally done with clarified butter. Alternatively, stop pouring all of 
the butter when you reach the milk solids at the bottom of the measuring cup.
The amount of butter called for in recipes varies wildly (I've seen anywhere from
2T to a whole stick of butter per yolk). I think it depends on the desired consistency
and how much butter you are willing to consume. **I tend to use 3T per yolk**.

Does not store well in the slightest.
