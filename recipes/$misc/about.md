## About my Recipes
Hi! As of May 2024 I have just finished making the skeleton of this "Recipes" 
section of my site. This is the start of a long-term project where I intend to 
catalogue all the dishes I learn over time in a way that I find useful, not unlike 
how one might hoard recipes on a set of notecards. 

Right now it is pretty much empty, and it will likely continue to be solidly incomplete
for the foreseeable future. As such, I don't really intend on anybody else 
using this at the moment (nor do I have any reason to believe that anybody would even 
see this, but here you are!). I will continue to publish updates and maintain this
page as a living document, both for my own convenience and as motiviation to 
keep improving it. 

My goal is to create a resource that is unique from popular recipe blogs: it should
cut fluffy exposition and advertisements/media; it should be concise and avoid 
over-prescriptive directions; and it should be somewhat encyclopedic, focusing on 
basic, extensible preparations rather than novel formulas. Here are some 
guidelines I will hold myself to:

1. Convenience

    Easy to use; try to fit all content within window and cut any fluff. write
    recipes in a way that is easy to follow. This means they are written as if 
    you already know more or less how to cook a particular dish. Much less
    details than a normal recipe
1. Flexibilty

    Only specify quantity of ingredients when exact ratios are required.  Clearly show
    what are the necessary components are of a dish, and what are extensions/additions
    to a dish. I should be able to quickly tell whether I have the pantry for a dish
    and easily adapt a recipe.
1. Comprehensiveness 

    Should cover a good variety of dishes and be easy to navigate. Will cover
    extremely simple preparations as well, not just for information but also as a reminder
    when deciding what to make.
