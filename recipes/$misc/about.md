## About my Recipes

written just for myself for now. like hoarding recipes on notecards. 
eventually, do want to reach the point where it is a useful tool for others,
by following these goals:

1. Convenience

    Easy to use; try to fit all content within window and cut any fluff. write
    recipes in a way that is easy to follow. This means they are written as if 
    you already know more or less how to cook a particular dish. Much less
    details than a normal recipe
1. Flexibilty

    Only specify quantity of ingredients when exact ratios are required.  Clearly show
    what are the necessary components are of a dish, and what are extensions/additions
    to a dish. I should be able to quickly tell whether I have the pantry for a dish
    and easily adapt a recipe.
1. Comprehensiveness 

    Should cover a good variety of dishes and be easy to navigate. Will cover
    extremely simple preparations as well, not for information but as a reminder
    when deciding what to make.
