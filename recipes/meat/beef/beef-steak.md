## Cooking Methods

### Pan-seared
Preheat oil in heavy pan until smoking. Sear dry, seasoned steaks, occasionally 
flipping, until a light-brown crust develops. Add butter and aromatics, flipping 
frequently and reducing heat if necessary until a well-developed crust forms and
center reaches ~10ยบ short of desired doneness (120ยบ for medium-rare). Let rest,
then serve.
