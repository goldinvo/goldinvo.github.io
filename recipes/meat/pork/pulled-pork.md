TODO: traditional methods, especially smoked

## Pressure Cooker Method
1. Cut pork butt/shoulder (bone-in is great) into 2-4 chunks and rub:
    - Brown sugar
    - Cayenne, Paprika
    - Onion, garlic powder
    - Mustard
    - Salt, pepper
    - etc.
2. Sear pork chunks very well. Then add:
    - Chicken broth or cola, to deglaze, and then some. (1.5 cups?)
    - Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, etc.
3. Cook at high pressure for an hour. Allow pressure to release naturally.
4. Remove pork and shred. Dress in sauce:
    - Barbecue sauce
    - Hot sauce
