A torchon lace rectangular doily<!--more-->.

This pattern is from the book *Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking* by Doris Southard.

Was my first time making sewings with bobbins and I can't believe I've been avoiding
them for so long! Being able to hold a finished lace doily in your hands without
any loose ends is such a magical feeling.
