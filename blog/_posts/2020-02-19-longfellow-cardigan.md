A simple stockinette cardigan<!--more-->. For this project, I used Brooklyn Tweed's recommended Loft yarn in Homemade Jam. This was my first time working with a woolen-spun yarn, and I love how "wooly" it is. At first, it seemed a little fragile and thin, but after working it up it meshes into something really rugged and durable.
