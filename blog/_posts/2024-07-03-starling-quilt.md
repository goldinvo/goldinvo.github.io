My first quilt!<!--more--> It serves as a nice substitute for my down comforter 
during the summer. I was pretty disappointed with my color choices so I
haphazardly rushed through the process of quilting the layers together. The scale
was also a lot larger than I was expecting.

I think I've come to find that quilting is not really my thing, though I like the
end product. If I do it again I'll piece together a more dense pattern and leave
the quilting to a long-arm service.
