This is a heavily adapted version of a crochet butterfly from the edging of this [Butterfly Night Table Doily](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/butterfly-night-table-doily-s-55){:target="_blank"} pattern. It uses a wire frame instead of starching, and has become one of my favorite little projects!

Along the perimeter of the wings, I crocheted around both the wire and the inner mesh with a simple sc and picot pattern and the occasional bead. I had to stuff as many sc's as I could in the gaps to cover the silver wire. I finished it off by attaching a freeform body and some antennae to cover the center.
