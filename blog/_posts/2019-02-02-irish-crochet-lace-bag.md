A fun little bag using my [Irish Crochet Motifs]({% post_url 2018-12-05-irish-crochet-motifs %})<!--more-->.
To avoid any seaming, I made it so that the fabric that the appliqu√©s were attached to was a 
roughly sewn pouch. All sides of the bag were sewn at the same time from the top down, with 
the back filled in with a simple netting. The top trim is a loop that wrapped around the
pouch and has holes to fit a ribbon. A Romanian cord strap was attached to the inside of the trim.

I initially put in a gold lining but have sinced removed it. I sadly gave it
away without remembering to take pictures without it. It was so light and pretty!
