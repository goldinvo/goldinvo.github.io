A beaded lace shawl<!--more--> made using the wonderful and well-written [Wild Swan pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wild-swan){:target="_blank"} by Anne-Lise Maigaard & Nim Teasdale. It is almost completely charted, making it easy to follow, and it requires minimal counting. Combined with a design that is beautiful, intricate, and engaging, this pattern is an absolute joy to knit. 

Here, I use Knit Picks Gloss Fingering in Clarity with all 2182(!) seed beads in size 8. I think the size 8 beads combined with their pearly white color was a poor choice as it makes the beads very difficult to see. Size 6 would have been more appropriate.
