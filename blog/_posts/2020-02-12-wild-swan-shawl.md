A beaded lace shawl<!--more--> made using the wonderful [Wild Swan pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/wild-swan) by Anne-Lise Maigaard & Nim Teasdale.

Here, I use Knit Picks Gloss Fingering in Clarity with all 2182(!) seed beads in size 8. I think the size 8 beads combined with their pearly white color was a poor choice as it makes the beads very difficult to see. Size 6 would have been more appropriate.
