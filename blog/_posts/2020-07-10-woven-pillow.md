A pillow made from some fabric I made that I didn't know what to do with. On a 7.5 dent rigid heddle, I used two strands of variegated fingering weight yarn as the warp threads and no. 10 crochet thread as the weft. This combination highlights the lovely stripes you get with variegated yarns. To form the pillow I folded the fabric in half, treating the crease as an edge to be sewn over so that it creates a faux seam, and then continued as normal.
