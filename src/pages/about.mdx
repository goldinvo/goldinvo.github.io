    # Welcome to my blog!

    On this site I post all sorts of things that I've made. I enjoy sewing, lacemaking, 
    cooking, knitting/crochet, and programming. 

    Under the "blog" tab is where I share all of my crafting endeavors. You can also 
    find links to some web apps I've made for use in my projects.

    The "notebooks" section is mostly for personal use right now. I am currently spending a lot of time publishing content, but it is still very much a work in progress.

    Please feel free to send any comments and feedback my way. I would really appreciate it!
