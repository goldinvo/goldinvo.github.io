    # Welcome to my blog!

    On this site I post all sorts of things that I've made. I enjoy sewing, lacemaking, 
    cooking, knitting/crochet, and programming. 

    Under the "blog" tab is where I share all of my crafting endeavors. You can also 
    find links to some web apps I've made for use in my projects.

    As someone who learns through note-taking, I also plan on keeping a set of 
    "notebooks" which compiles important things I've found and want to keep reference of.
    Right now, "recipes" is the only notebook I have a significant amount of content for,
    but I plan on adding more in the near future.

    Please feel free to send any comments and feedback my way. I would really appreciate it!
