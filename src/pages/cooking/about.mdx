    # About this Notebook
    Hi! Welcome to my cooking page. This is a long-term project where I intend to 
    catalog (hoard) recipes and other cooking tidbits. It's basically my equivalent
    of a recipes binder or box of index cards. My goal is to create a convenient, 
    non-prescriptive, and comprehensive resource without ads or any extra fluff. 

    I am starting this project in May 2024, and it will probably be quite a while until
    I have enough content for it to be useful. I'll update this about page to be all
    spiffy when that happens.

    Please send any feedback, comments, and suggestions to goldin@goldinvo.com
