A dust cover I threw together for my Yamaha P-125. I started with a quilted 14 by 3 panel of 4½" disappearing 9-patch quarters (3⅜" patches, SA included), trimmed it to fit with a stand cutout, and added a 6¼" trim.

I mostly went with this design as a quick stash-busting project, though it ended up a little wild-looking. I'm thinking about dyeing the whole thing black to unify it a bit, but I'll save that project for when I am less invested in how it turns out.
