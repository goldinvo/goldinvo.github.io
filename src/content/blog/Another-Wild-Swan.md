My [second go]({% post_url blog/2020-02-12-wild-swan-shawl %}) at the Wild Swan Shawl. <!--more-->
I went up to size 6 seed beads and again somehow found the willpower to place all 2,000+ of them.
The yarn is a very nice warm-white single-ply wool/silk blend from my local yarn shop (unfortunately I've lost the tag).

Ironically the pictures of this shawl make it seem almost identical to the first one.
I can say that the yarn, colors, and drape are so much nicer though. Pictures
also really do not do beads justice.
