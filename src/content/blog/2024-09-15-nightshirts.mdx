At first I meant to make a pair of pajamas, but I ended up opting for nightshirts since they are much cheaper and easier to make. They also organize better in the dresser.

I made two identical garments for this project. One is in a lightweight striped seersucker, and the other is a slightly-more-heavy brushed checked cotton shirting.

I used McCall's M8443 for the pattern. I skipped the patch pocket and added a tab to the side split to make a [lapped flat-felled split side seam](https://handmadebycarolyn.com.au/2013/12/lapped-flat-felled-split-side-sea.html). All seams were flat-felled. I worked the side/underarm seam to the inside of the garment with the expectation that I would have to partially whip it by hand, but surprisingly I was able to do the entire arm on my machine. I also slightly modified the neck facing to be stronger.

This was not a challenging project, but I am super happy with the results! The seersucker is noticeably better in warm weather. The brushed cotton is warmer and feels more like classic sleepwear though. Once I find another fabric that matches the set, I'll have to make a third!
