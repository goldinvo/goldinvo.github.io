A nightshirt is an unusual choice of sleepwear, but I prefer them over pajama sets for the following reasons:
1. They are very easy (and cheap!) to make yourself.
2. They are organize better. No need to match tops with bottoms. And they fold nicely!
3. You have a freebie Ebenezer Scrooge costume for Halloween ðŸ˜Ž

## Construction

I made two identical garments for this project. One is in a lightweight striped seersucker, and the other is a slightly-more-heavy brushed checked cotton shirting. Both are blue, but I'm bad with cameras.

I used McCall's M8443 for the pattern. I skipped the patch pocket and added a tab to the side split to make a [lapped flat-felled split side seam](https://handmadebycarolyn.com.au/2013/12/lapped-flat-felled-split-side-sea.html). All seams were flat-felled. I worked the side/underarm seam to the inside of the garment with the expectation that I would have to partially whip it by hand, but surprisingly I was able to do the entire arm on my machine. I also slightly modified the neck facing to be stronger.

## Finished Garment
This was not a challenging project, but I am super happy with the results! The seersucker is noticeably better in warm weather. The brushed cotton is warmer and feels more like classic sleepwear though. Eventually I will have to make a third nightshirt to match my laundry schedule. I haven't done so yet because I need to source another fabric in blue to match the \~sleepwear aesthetic\~
