Welcome to the first post of my *Home-Sewn Wardrobe* series, where I’ll be documenting my journey in creating a basic collection of menswear staples from scratch. Will I succeed in building a complete, functional wardrobe? Or will I throw in the towel, disillusioned by the reality of how time-consuming, expensive, and difficult home sewing is compared to buying ready-made garments? Stick around to find out!

All jokes aside, I just wanted to highlight my perspective on this project. As someone who sticks to non-adventurous, casual menswear, I can confidently say that I can find any garment I want for less than it would cost to make myself. These ready-made garments are of perfectly satisfactory quality and durability. And if I’m willing to spend a bit more, I can buy a garment whose quality I would be hard-pressed to match without significant time and effort. I’m not sewing my own wardrobe to challenge these facts or to fix any problems with fit or style—off-the-rack suits me just fine. My goal is purely the satisfaction of building a minimalist, intentional collection of handmade garments, with an emphasis on craftsmanship and detail.

In my experience, resources on making casual menswear are hard to come by. Solid colored shirts and pants are certainly not as complicated nor as interesting as making costumes or fine-tailored suits! Nevertheless, the lack of guidance often left me second-guessing whether this journey was worth it. Now that I’ve taken the plunge, I hope this series serves two purposes:
1. To share my experience with fellow novices and amateurs
2. To act as a personal reference, helping me improve and refine similar garments over time (because after making several muslins of various pants patterns, I _really_ need to stop starting from scratch—there’s only so much fitting one person needs to do!).

That being said, lets get started with the first garment: a pair of pleated pants! 

## Method
This is the first pair of pants I've made that include front pleats. I decided to try them out after seeing some gorgeous Todd Snyder trouser advertisements (I definitely did not expect them to look as good as the ads the first time around). I also hoped that the pleats serve as a good way to add space in the upper leg, as I can never seem to find pants that fit my thigh. 

### Pattern
The fabric I used was a lightweight (166 gsm) charcoal twill at $14.50/yd (44"). The base pattern was view A of Vogue's V1996. It is a good quality pattern, but it doesn't include many facing pieces. After making a toile, I made the following adjustments:
- Raised the waistline by 1"
- Reduced the leg length by 1"
- Fitted the waistband
- Redrafted all secondary components to match my favorite ready-to-wear article (waistband, front and back pockets, and fly pieces).

### Construction
I tried an unordinary method of sewing the double-welt back pockets. Conventional methods result in unfinished "flaps" (two triangular and two long skinny flaps) on the inside of the garment hidden behind the pocket lining. I wanted to imitate ready-to-wear welted pockets by encasing the unfinished edges within the pocket lining and the pocket facing. I did this by basting the pocket bag to the wrong side of the main fabric, stitching the welts to the right side (which should be large enough to also act as the facing pieces), and slashing and turning the welts so that everything is enclosed in the pocket bag. 

All other construction steps roughly followed the standard pattern directions. To do a bias bound center seam, I attached the beginning of the bias tape to the front piece as I was working the fly (as the turned fly facing partially obstructs the center seam edges). The side seam and inseam were serged, and all other seams were either self-finished or finished with bias tape.

The buttonholes and belt-loops were hand-stitched. Topstitching was kept to a minimum.
## Reflection
### The Good
- I am really fond of the [zipper fly method](https://simplicity.com/how-to-sew-fly-front-zipper) presented in the pattern. I think it is a very intuitive method and it also produces a result that seems to be identical with my favorite RTW chinos.
- The interior finishing looks fantastic! Even better than the outside of the garment, ironically. 
- Fits my thighs very well compared to RTW and my previous pants attempts.
- Got a lot of hand-stitching practice. Being able to stitch by hand makes mistakes a lot less worrisome.

### To Improve
- I'm pretty unhappy with the fabric choice. Pre-washing the fabric sizing off completely ruined the drape. It also feels much scratchier and holds on to wrinkles easily.
- The pants may need more ease to drape properly, though it is difficult to tell if better fabric choice alone would solve this.
-  The lower leg was surprisingly narrow compared to the toile. I think it may be because I finished the edges off with my serger, taking off a bit of the allowance. I tried to compensate for this when sewing the side seams, but it may have not been enough. It may also be because I didn't sew the 5/8" seam allowance on my toile very accurately compared to the 3/8" that I am used to. 
    - I was able fix this issue nicely by taking the rest of the available seam allowance, restitching right up to the serged edge.
- After increasing the rise, I should've extended the length of the darts and taken in the waist at the sides instead of increasing the width of the darts. Making these changes would also give a more flat surface to install the back pockets on.
- The angle of the pocket piece does not point directly down, so has a tendency to not lie flat.
- The back pockets were kind of a disaster. I made a lot of careless mistakes (including forgetting interfacing on the main fabric and welt pieces). The welt lips were pretty uneven as well. For the next time, I want to try pre-sewing the folded welt pieces (these welts were ironed in place after being attached). I also want to do a better job at basting/attaching the pocket piece to the back of the main fabric, giving a better guide for where to place the welts and where to cut. 
    - I resolved to simply sew the back pockets shut. 

### Takeaway
I am fairly satisfied with the final piece. The interior looks great, and the mistakes I made in the back pocket are hardly noticeable from a distance. The fabric and drape of the garment is really not how I would like though. I think I will be able to wear it frequently, but it is not my favorite and I'll try and make a better version to replace it when I find the right fabric.
