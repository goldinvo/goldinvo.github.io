I've always been frustrated with the poor fit and fussiness of the pants patterns I've owned, so I decided to start from scratch and draft a new one. I based it pretty closely on what you'd find in ready-to-wear garments, with the only real exception being a button fly—which I found way simpler to construct. Though honestly, after sewing all those buttons and buttonholes, I’m not totally sure I prefer it over a zipper.

I started getting a little impatient once I hit the welt pockets and everything after that. Luckily, everything turned out fine—more or less. The one thing that really bugged me was forgetting to interface the inner waistband, which left it feeling kind of floppy and lacking structure.

That said, I’m actually super happy with how these turned out. They’re something I’d totally wear out in public without hesitation, which feels like a solid success to me.
