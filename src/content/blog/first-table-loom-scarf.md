A simple scarf to get familiar with my new table loom<!--more-->. I used [Ashford's SampleIt loom video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0aFlG7294w) as a reference. I don't really like the tie-off finishing method though. In a later project, I found that hemstitching the edge made a much nicer result.
