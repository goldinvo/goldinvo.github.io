I had quite a bit of white linen yardage I never got around to using. I decided to use it for a few garments, but I needed to dye it first, because I hate wearing pure white.

I tea stained the yardage in 2-yard segments to fit in the largest bowls I had on hand. The bowls were still a bit small, so the fabric was scrunched up which actually created a pretty nice looking tie-dye effect. I'm hoping it lasts over several washes, but if not I'll re-dye the garment with something more permanent.

The pattern is Wardrobe By Me's [Woven Polo](https://wardrobebyme.com/products/woven-polo-shirt-pattern?srsltid=AfmBOoo5T0xapjwBUP-Gr8tkagh8G0WGcBi-O5aKlnLp7OP9B5lAxFeT) in large.
