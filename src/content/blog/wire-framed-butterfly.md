A crochet lace butterfly<!--more-->.

This is a heavily adapted version of a crochet butterfly from the edging of this [Butterfly Night Table Doily](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/butterfly-night-table-doily-s-55) pattern.

Along the perimeter of the wings, I crocheted around both the wire and the inner mesh with a simple sc and picot pattern with the occasional bead. I had to stuff as many sc's in the gaps as I could in order to cover the silver wire. I finished it off by attaching a freeform body and some antennae to cover the center.
