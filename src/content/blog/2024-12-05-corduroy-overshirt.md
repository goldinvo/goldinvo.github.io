This is a jacket I made a year or so ago but never posted, because I wasn't very happy with the sleeves and cuffs. The cuff interfacing was way too stiff, and the the pattern I used had a slit instead of a sleeve placket. 

After seeing an almost identical garment fetching a high price in the store, I was reminded to pull it back out of the closet. It doesn't look that bad anymore! I guess sometimes you need to put things away and look again later with a fresh pair of eyes.
