A few sample trims from my foray into bobbin lacemaking. All of these patterns are sequential lessons from the book [Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking](https://books.google.com/books/about/Lessons_in_Bobbin_Lacemaking.html?id=ZH2GwtfD5BUC) by Doris Southard. The lessons that are easy to follow and the pacing/ordering of lessons is very well thought out. I'm so excited to get to the section with doilies.

Some parts where I strayed from the book:
- I used a flat piece of styrofoam, and later a cookie pillow, over the 
roller pillows suggested to be made
- I just did short samples of the lace edgings with single use pattern cards (tracing paper "laminated" with clear tape). 
- The scale of the patterns were 1-to-1 from the book using tracing paper, which I found was
good to use with no. 30 crochet cotton.
