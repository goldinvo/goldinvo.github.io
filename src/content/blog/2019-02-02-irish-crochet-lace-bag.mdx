A fun little bag using my [Irish Crochet Motifs](/blog/irish-crochet-motifs).
The bag was filled in from the top trim, which is a loop. The netting wrapped 
around the backing fabric. I attached a Romanian cord strap and fed a ribbon through
the trim. 

I initially put in a gold lining but have since removed it. I sadly gave it
away without remembering to take a picture sans lining.
