An abominable mishmash of projects I didn't care for anymore<!--more-->. It started out
as a panel for a woven picnic blanket. I gave up and started stuffing it with
old yarns from abandoned projects, entire scraps of cut crocheted fabric, and
old socks. Balancing it all out is [Sophie's Mandala](https://lookatwhatimade.net/crafts/yarn/crochet/free-crochet-patterns/sophies-mandala-part-3-large/), which I cut out of my abandoned [Sophie's Universe](https://lookatwhatimade.net/crafts/yarn/crochet/sophies-universe-cal-2015/sophies-universe-cal-2015-information/) project.

It is so ugly.
