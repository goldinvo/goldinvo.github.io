Another simple scarf. I used the same weight yarns (doubled fingering and no.10 crochet cotton) as [my last weaving](/blog/woven-pillow), but this time I wanted to see what would happen if I used a strong color for the weft threads instead. I think it created a nice texture, and I think that some really cool gradients can be made by varying how tightly you pack the weft thread (which I did by accident towards the ends of the scarf).
