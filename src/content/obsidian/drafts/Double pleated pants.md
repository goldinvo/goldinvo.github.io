This is a series I'm starting to record my progress on making home-sewn everyday garments. I have made a few garments before but I find that I switch patterns too much. This takes too much time especially when I try and change the fit/redraft each pattern because I am scared I did something wrong. In this series I will keep track of the things I want to improve. This way I can do more iterative improvement. We are going tos tart with a pari of pleated pants. my goal is to have as beautiful of an interior as possible

## Method
### Pattern
I'm starting with the view B of vogue V2138948. After making a toile, I raised the waistline by 1 inch and reduced the leg length by 1 inch. All other pieces are redrafted, mostly matching my favorite pair of RTW pants.
- The front pocket bag linings were changed were folded instead of extending to the center front
- I also added separate pocket facing pieces in the main fabric. 
- The back pockets to be a long rectangle, when closed will reach the waistband. 
- Separated folded waistband into two pieces seamed together.
### Construction
1. Sew darts and pleats on front/back pieces. Stay stitch.
2. Sew front pocket bags and back double welted pocket bags, finishing pocket linings with french seams.
3. Sew front fly, such that I do not sew the seam at the crotch and attach the bias binding partway into the fly facing. 
4. Sew back pieces to front using side and inseam.
5. Finally, sew center seam and finish with bias tape
6. Attach waistband

## Reflection
### The Good
1. Found a zipper fly method I really like. The general construction of the trousers as well. Was able to construct the majority without consulting references.
2. Learned to clip the edge when folding the waistband binding
4. The interior looks fantastic!
5. Fits my thighs very well compared to RTW and my previous pants attempts.
6. Hand sewing the belt loops was very nice. I should hand sew more often.

### The Bad
1. The lower leg was too narrow. I think it may be because I finished the edges off with my serger, taking off a bit of the allowance. I tried to accommodate this, but probably did not do it enough. It may also be because I do not sew a 5/8th seam on my toile very accurately, while my 3/8th's seam i used in the main pieces is generally very accurate. I was able fix it nicely by taking the rest of the available seam allowance, stitching right up to the serged edge.
2. When increasing the rise, I should've extended the darts rather than raising them up. Since I also used them to take in the waistline, the increase in fullness from the waist to about 2 1/2 inches down was very dramatic. This was not noticeable in the result though because of how much ease there is in the hips. Longer darts that extended past the pocket placement would likely give a flatter surface for the pockets as well.
3. The fold of the pocket piece does not hang straight down, so has a tendency to not lie flat

### The Ugly
The double welt pockets were an absolute disaster. I probably was way too tired when sewing them but kept chugging along as I made mistake after mistake. 
1. I forgot to attach interfacing to neither the main fabrics nor the welts.
2. I accidentally snipped into the wrong part of the pocket lining when slashing. I had to hand darn this together.
3. The welt pieces were horribly uneven (I attempted a method where the welts are ironed into place after attachment).
4. I forgot to add a main fabric facing piece inside the pocket.
While I did do a test swatch of my new method of a double welted pocket, in hindsight it should've been clear that I was looking for trouble. The swatch was also pretty sloppy, but I chalked it up as being due to my lack of effort for the swatch, that would be fixed on the main piece. 

## Takeaways
I am pretty satisfied with this project as a starting point. There are plenty of places to tweak where I have a concrete idea of what I want to change. The biggest focus now is honing the fit, and finding a better method of making the welt pockets. Right now I want to try sewing the lining piece to the back of the main fabric, slashing, then attaching the pre-folded welts. I am very satisfied with the finishings of the project.
