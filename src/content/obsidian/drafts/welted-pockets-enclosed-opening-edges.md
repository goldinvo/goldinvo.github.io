title: 'Welted Pockets with Enclosed Pocket Opening Edges'
grade: B
---

## Motivation
Welted pockets are internal pockets that require the main fabric be slashed to create a pocket opening. A rectangular pocket opening creates raw edges (two triangles and two long flaps) that are turned to the inside of the garment.

Conventional methods for tailoring and home sewing result in these raw edges lying between the pocket bag and the main fabric. This is perfectly acceptable as it is protected and hidden completely by the pocket bag. However, they can still be seen when you pull back the pocket bag. 

On the other hand, ready-to-wear garments are [constructed by industrial machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3p8AyIkfbs) which put the raw pocket opening edges inside of the pocket bag. The method in this post emulates this type of construction.

Currently written with a focus on a double welted pocket on the back of a pair of pants, but should be able to extend it to single welt and other pocket locations as well.

## Materials
- Pocket bag (lightweight lining fabric), cut as a rectangle wider than the pocket opening and tall enough to be folded to form a pocket and have both ends be tall enough to reach the waistband
- Pocket bag facing (fashion fabric)
- Two welt pieces (fashion fabric), not folded. Interfaced.
- Interfacing for main back piece.

## Method
1. Mark the pocket opening using an "H" on the right side of main piece and inside of pocket bag. Align the two pieces, main piece wrong side facing pocket bag outside face. Baste them together, outside of the pocket opening markings.
2. Butt the two welt pieces against each other on the marked pocket opening. Sew the welts along the long edges of the pocket opening.
3. Slash the opening without cutting the welts. Press the welt pieces open, turn and press again. Fold the welt pieces to form the welts, and press very well into position. The lips of the welts may be basted together and pressed again to keep during the rest of the process.
4. Sew everything else
