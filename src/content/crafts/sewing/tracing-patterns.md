Methods of tracing/copying a pattern (such as the tissue from a pattern envelope) to a another piece of paper:
1. Transparent paper:
    - Use transparent tracing paper or some other transparent media to copy the pattern markings
2. Lightbox:
    - Illuminate the pattern from behind to show through on the main paper. Can tape pieces to a sunny window to substitute for light box
3. Sharpie Bleedthrough:
    - Place pattern on top of main paper and trace with permanent marker, allowing the ink to bleed through onto the main paper.
4. Tracing wheel:
    - Use a tracing wheel and enough pressure to transfer pin prick markings to the underlying main paper, and sketch in the lines afterwards. Alternatively, use tracing paper to transfer.
5. Cut and trace:
    - Cut out the pattern and trace onto the main paper, as you would on fabric.
