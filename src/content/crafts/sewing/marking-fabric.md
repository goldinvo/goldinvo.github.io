## Marking Tools
Thread Tracing
: Trace line markings using thread. Can be a running stitch (for only one layer of fabric), or something like tailor's tacks.
Tailor's Tacks
: A method where the multiple tails of thread are left inside of marked points that can be seen from both sides of the fabric. With a double tail of thread take small stitches, leaving generously sized loops of thread between each stitch, such that when the loops are cut the fabric can be separated partly. The threads between the two layers of fabric are snipped leaving behind tacks in both pieces.
Chalk
: Can be found as a wax/clay based pad, as a powder in chalk dispensers, or as a pencil.
Pencils and Heat-sensitive or Washable Pens
: Test to make sure that markings fully disappear or are inconspicuous.
Tracing Wheel and Tracing Paper
: Use the pressure of the wheel to transfer pigment from the tracing paper onto the fabric.
## Methods of Transferring Patterns to Fabric
### Tailor's Method
Start with a pattern piece that *does not* include seam allowances. Weigh the pattern piece onto the fabric and trace the outline. Transfer the internal markings as you see fit. Many markings can be re-drafted with chalk directly onto the fabric. All chalk markings only need to be on the top piece, as all seam and internal markings will have thread tracing or tailor's tacks. This makes markings last longer, and keeps them visible through all sides and layers of fabric. As the seam line is marked, the allowance is only roughly outlined or cut out entirely by eye.

### Cut, pin, and Mark Method
Pin or weigh a pattern piece that includes seam allowances onto the fabric. Cut the fabric along the outline of the pattern piece. Transfer any internal markings, using a pin to poke through certain points of the pattern as necessary (the pin head may be forced through the pattern piece too). Use chalk or a discreet/disappearing marking tool. All markings will need to be transferred to each layer of fabric, and to the backsides of each piece as necessary.

### Tracing Wheel Method
Sandwich folded carbon transfer paper between the layers of fabric and trace all pattern markings with a tracing wheel. This should transfer markings to each piece of fabric. Use a pin and marking tool to mark the opposite side of fabrics as necessary.
