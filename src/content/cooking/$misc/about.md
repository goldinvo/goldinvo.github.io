## About my Recipes
Hi! Welcome to my recipes page. This is a long-term project where I intend to 
catalog (hoard) recipes and other cooking tidbits. It's basically my equivalent
of a recipes binder or box of index cards. My goal is to create a convenient, 
non-prescriptive, and comprehensive resource without ads or any extra fluff. 

I am starting this project in May 2024, and it will probably be quite a while until
I have enough content for it to be useful. I'll update this about page to be all
spiffy when that happens.

Please send any feedback, comments, and suggestions to goldin@goldinvo.com
