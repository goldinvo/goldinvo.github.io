- 260g whole milk (2 cups)
- Vanilla bean, or extract
- 115+ g sugar (optionally toast)
- 30g cornstarch
- pinch salt
- 4 (to 6) large yolks
- 2 Tbsp butter, in small cubes

1. Bring milk to a bare simmer, with scraped vanilla seeds (including rest of bean, to be removed later) if using. Set aside to cool slightly and infuse.
2. Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and salt with yolks until light and airy.
3. Gradually add milk to yolk mixture while whisking constantly.
4. Return mixture to pan, heating and whisking until properly thickened. Add extract if using.
5. Stir in butter and optionally place in ice bath (in a bowl). Cover, using plastic wrap/parchment against surface to prevent a skin. Chill thoroughly.
6. Whisk until smooth before using.
