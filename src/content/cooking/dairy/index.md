## Notable Components of Milk
Water
: The majority of milk's composition.

Milk fat/Butterfat
: Forms fat globules. Globule membranes tolerate heat, such that milk and cream
can be heated and boiled. On the other hand, milk fat that has been frozen 
easily clumps into grains of butter. 

Curd
: *Casein* proteins. Tolerant of heat unless in acidic environments, where 
they will coagulate.

Whey
: Milk proteins that remains after the curd forms. Also resistant to heat.

Lactose
: Milk sugar, giving milk its sweet taste. Often indigestible.

## Milk Treatments

Raw Milk
: Has a fresh taste that is otherwise altered after pasteurization. Fat-rich 
cream will rise to the top when left to stand *(creaming)*.

Pasteurization
: Moderate heat treatment that kills microbes and deactivates milk enzymes. 
Extends shelf life while minimizing changes in flavor.

    Batch Pasteurization
    : A batch of milk is gently heated and stirred for a good length of time. The most mild method.

    High-temperature Short-time (HTST)
    : Milk is pumped through a heat exchanger, being exposed to more heat for a 
    brief period of time. Develops a cooked flavor.

    Ultra-high Temperature
    : Milk is heated at a very high temperature almost instantaneously. Becomes more
    cooked but is also shelf stable. 

Homogenization
: Hot milk is pumped at high pressure through small nozzles to decimate the size
of fat globules, preventing creaming.

Low-Fat Milks
: Centrifuges separate milk and cream, allowing for milk to be made with different fat content.
(Skim, 1%, 2%, and whole milk at about 3.5%).
