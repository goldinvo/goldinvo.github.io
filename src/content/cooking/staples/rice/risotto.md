description: "A creamy and savory Italian dish of starchy rice cooked in broth."
grade: E
---
- Onion or shallot; olive oil
- Starchy Italian rice (e.g. arborio, carnaroli, vialone nano)
- Dry white wine
- Stock, warmed. Keeping about 4 cups on hand per cup of rice is safe.
- Butter; parmesan or grana padano
- Salt and pepper

Sweat onion in olive oil. Add rice and cook until becoming lightly toasted and translucent. Add a good bit of wine and allow for it to cook off completely. Incrementally add stock as the rice absorbs liquid, stirring frequently to release starches and prevent scorching, until just before done. Use only enough liquid to get the right texture. Melt in butter and cheese and serve.
