- Meat mixture:
    - **Ground pork**, **oil**
    - **Shaoxing wine**, light and dark **soy sauce**, **Sichuan peppercorn**, **etc.**
    - **Ya cai** (芽菜 preserved mustard greens)
- Sauce:
    - ~2 Tbsp **sesame paste** or peanut butter and sesame oil
    - ~2 Tbsp light **soy sauce**
    - ~2 Tbsp **zhenjiang vinegar**
    - 1/2 cup homemade **chili oil** (with solids)
    - **Sugar**
    - **Sichuan peppercorn**, toasted whole and ground
    - **Garlic**, minced
- Fresh Chinese-style **wheat noodles**. Not too thin.
- *Topping suggestions:* **Roasted peanut, green onions, bean sprouts, other vegetables, Sichuan peppercorn, etc.**

For the meat mixture, stir fry the ground pork, boiling off all liquid when adding seasonings. Mix in ya cai. 

Combine all ingredients for the sauce, being sure to properly break up the sesame paste before adding too much liquid to the bowl. 

When ready to serve, boil the noodles. Mix in with the sauce in the bowls, adding some of the water from boiling to thin as necessary. Top with meat mixture and any additional toppings and serve.

## Hong Kong Style
TODO: Served as a noodle soup instead of dry. Peanut/sesame forward. I haven't gotten around to trying this one yet.
