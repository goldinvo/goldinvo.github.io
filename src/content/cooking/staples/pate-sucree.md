A sweet shortbread crust used in tarts.


[Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/pate-sucree-tart-shell-recipe) (Yields 2 crusts):
- 2 sticks soft unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch-thick slices
- 170g sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 425g AP flour
- 8g salt
- 30g heavy cream
- 1 Tbsp vanilla extract

With a stand mixer:
1. Cream butter and sugar.
2. Gradually incorporate eggs.
3. Add flour and salt, and mix on low until just crumbly. Add cream and vanilla and mix
until dough comes together. Do not over-mix.
4. Portion into 2 plastic-wrapped disks and thoroughly chill. Freeze if saving for later.

Roll out with flour to 1/8th of an inch. After it's in the tart pan, trim leaving a quarter inch
overhang for shrinkage and chill well.

Preheat oven to 350º. Trim the edges and place pie weights (aluminum foil and sugar). On a sheet tray,
bake for about 35 minutes until fully set and golden. Remove foil and sugar, and
bake longer if needed. Cool on wire rack.
