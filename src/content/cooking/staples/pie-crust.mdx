NYT (2 9-inch crusts):

- 300g AP flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 20 Tbsp cold butter, cubed
- 4-8 Tbsp ice water


In a food processor, pulse flour and salt, then pulse with butter until you get lima-bean 
clumps. Add barely enough water so dough can clump together. Gather into 2 plastic-wrapped disks.
Rest in fridge for 1 hour to 2 days or freeze. Thaw overnight.
