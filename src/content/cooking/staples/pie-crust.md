Ratios from [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/448-pie-crust) (2 x 9-inch pie pan crusts):

- 300g AP flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 20 Tbsp cold butter, cubed
- 4-8 Tbsp ice water
- Optionally 1-2 Tbsp sugar

In a food processor, pulse flour and salt together. Then pulse with butter until you get lima-bean sized clumps. Add barely enough water for the dough to start to clumping together. Gather into 2 plastic-wrapped disks.
Rest in the fridge for at least an hour or freeze for later. Thaw overnight.
