title: No-Knead Bread
---

Jim Lahey's popular no-knead bread recipe that doesn't require any attention 
during bulk fermentation. 


- 430 g AP/bread flour
- 1/4+ tsp yeast
- 2 tsp salt
- 345 g water

Stir water into dry until wet. Cover at room temp for 12-18 hours.

After fermentation, fold (lifting from the center) as many times as the dough 
allows, forming into a ball at the end, resting as needed.  Rise, covered and 
on parchment, for 2 hours. 

Place into a dutch oven preheated to 450ÂºF. Bake 
covered for 30 min, and uncovered for 15-30 min. Cool on rack.
