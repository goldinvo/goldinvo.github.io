- **Macaroni**, cooked in salted water and rinsed until cool
- **Shallots** or red onion, optionally soaked in cold water; **celery**; **bell peppers**; **carrot** (opt.); **pickles** (opt.); **scallion** (opt.); **etc**. â€” all finely diced.
- **Mayo** (about a heaping cup per pound of dry pasta); **mustard**; **clean vinegar** or pickle juice. **Sour cream** (opt.) with the mayo is also good.
- **Salt, pepper, sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, lemon, hot sauce, etc.**

Combine dressing to taste. Toss everything together in a large bowl, adjusting to taste. Refrigerate. Macaroni will absorb water over time, so you can optionally make some sauce on the side to add later.
