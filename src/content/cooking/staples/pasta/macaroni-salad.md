- Macaroni, cooked in salted water and rinsed until cool
- Shallots or red onion, optionally soaked in cold water; celery; bell peppers; carrot; pickles; scallion; etc. â€” all finely diced. First three ingredients are the most important
- Mayo (about a heaping cup per pound of dry pasta); mustard; clean vinegar or pickle juice. Sour cream with the mayo is also good.
- Salt, pepper, sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, lemon, hot sauce, etc.

Combine dressing to taste. Toss everything together in a large bowl, adjusting to taste. Refrigerate. Macaroni will absorb water over time, so you can optionally make some sauce on the side to add later.
