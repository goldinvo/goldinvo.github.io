- Macaroni, cooked in salted water and rinsed until cool
- Shallots or red onion; celery; bell peppers; carrot; pickles; scallion; etc. â€” all finely diced. First three ingredients are the most important
- Mayo (about a heaping cup per pound of dry pasta); mustard; clean vinegar. Sour cream with the mayo is also good.
- Salt, pepper, sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, lemon, hot sauce, etc.

Combine ingredients, incrementally to taste when possible. Refrigerate. Macaroni will absorb water over time, so you can optionally make some sauce on the side to add later.
