In a baking dish, layer lasagna noodles, sauce, and cheese/bechamel. On the bottom 
leave a layer of sauce and on the top give a generous layer of cheese. You can
get away with distributing layers quite haphazardly. Bake at 375ยบ for more than
a half hour.

For oven-ready lasagna noodles, soak in water first, and add milk for moisture 
if ingredients are not wet enough.
