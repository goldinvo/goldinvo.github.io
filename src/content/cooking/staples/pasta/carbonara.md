- **Spaghetti** or similar pasta
- **Guanciale**/pancetta/bacon, cut into lardons
- **Eggs** (more yolks preferred); **parmesan/pecorino**/a mix, finely grated; **salt**; **black pepper**. 
    - I prefer ~1-2 yolks per person, with barely any white or 1-2 whites for larger batches, and plenty of cheese.

Boil pasta in salted water. Meanwhile, fry the lardons in a little olive oil until the fat has rendered and the meat is browned. Make sure the pan is not too hot by the time the pasta is ready. Also, mix egg, cheese, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl.

Just before the pasta is done, remove and toss in the pan with fat and pork. Transfer everything to the bowl and toss, adding additional pasta water as needed (more than you think) for a creamy sauce. Heat gently while tossing constantly until rich and smooth, without overcooking the egg sauce, either in the pan or by putting the mixing bowl over simmering water (double boiler). Plate, dress in pepper and grated cheese, and serve immediately.
