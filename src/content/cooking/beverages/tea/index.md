## What is Tea?
The brewing of tea leaves, from the tree *Camellia sinensis*, originates in China. Green teas are the oldest, while darker teas are relatively modern. Exported tea (especially black tea) became popularized in the West around the 17th century. 

Fresh tea leaves contain caffeine and bitter/astringent phenolic substances as a defense mechanism against animals. Young tea leaves contain the highest concentration and are the most desirable. Tea manufacturing involve processes that use the leaf's enzymes to "ferment" the leaf, breaking down and transforming compounds to be more complex, full, and less bitter/astringent.

### Major Varieties
- **Green tea** is made by cooking fresh or barely withered leaves to inactivate enzymes, pressing them to release moisture, and then drying. Japanese varieties will cook using steam, preserving a grassy flavor. Chinese varieties cook using a hot pan, adding a toasted, savory flavor. Green teas are closest to the bitter and astringent characteristics of a fresh leaf.
- **Oolong tea** is made by withering the tea significantly, then lightly bruising the leaves and allowing to ferment. It is then pan-fired, rolled, and dried. This process allows for a modest amount of enzymatic transformation.
- **Black tea** is made by withering the tea and rolling/bruising by a large amount. It is fermented and then air-dried. This maximizes enzymatic transformation and produces a very dark and complex tea.
- There are many other more unusual varieties, which I do not include.

## Brewing
In the West, a small amount of black tea (relative to the amount of water) is brewed for several minutes. In Asia, a large amount of tea is steeped for a shorter amount of time, and the same leaves will be used for many infusions. Cooler water is used for green teas, while water closer to a boil is used for oolong or black teas.

Bottled water may be preferred. Water should ideally have moderate mineral content and a neutral pH.
