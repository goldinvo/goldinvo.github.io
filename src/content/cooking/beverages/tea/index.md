## Major Varieties
Fresh leaves begin with a grassy and astringent flavor, which are broken down into a full flavor profile by various processing methods.

Green Tea
: Fresh leaves are cooked to inactivate enzymes, pressed to release moisture, and then dried. Japanese varieties may cook using steam, preserving a grassy flavor. Chinese varieties cook using a hot pan, adding a toasted, savory flavor. Green teas are closest to the bitter and astringent characteristics of the fresh leaf.
Oolong Tea
: Tea leaves are allowed to wither, lightly bruised, and then fermented. It is then pan-fired, rolled, and dried. This process allows for a modest amount of enzymatic transformation.
Black Tea
: Tea is withered and heavily rolled/bruised. It is then fermented and air-dried. This maximizes enzymatic transformation and produces a very dark and complex tea.

Other types of teas have similar variations in their processing, and may include additional flavorings. Herbal teas are infusions that do not include true tea leaves.

## Brewing
In the West, a small amount of black tea (relative to the amount of water) is brewed for several minutes. In Asia, a large amount of tea is steeped for a shorter amount of time, and the same leaves will be used for many infusions. Cooler water is used for green teas, while water closer to a boil is used for oolong or black teas.
