For half gallon:
- tea, green or black
- 6 cups water
- 1/2 cup sugar
- About a cup starter, and pellicle from previous brew (first fermentation)
- **Bottling:** juice, chopped/blended fruit (may need to strain), ginger, herbs, spices, etc. Sugar content boosts carbonation.
<!-- endstub -->

Brew strong tea using half of the water, dissolve sugar, add rest of water and let cool 
to room temp. Add to jar with starting culture and pellicle. Ferment, covered 
but still breathable (e.g. coffee filter), for 7-14 days at warm room temp (taste to determine
when its done).

Distribute into bottles with any additions and seal, fermenting for 2-7 days while
watching the bubbles in the bottle. Refrigerate when proper carbonation is reached.
