For a half gallon brewing jar:
- **Black tea bags**, or loose leaf tea.
- **Water**
- 1/2 cup **sugar**
- About 1 cup of **culture** ("SCOBY") from the previous brew, or from store-bought unflavored kombucha (use more). Optionally keep the pellicle as well.
- *For bottling (optional):* **juice**, chopped/blended **fruit** (may need to strain), **ginger**, **herbs**, **spices**, **etc**. Sugar content boosts carbonation.

Brew strong tea using only a portion of the water needed to fill the brewing vessel. Dissolve sugar while still hot, and let cool to room temp, adding the rest of the cold water to speed things up if needed.

Add to the jar with the starting culture and pellicle, and top up with more water if necessary. Cover with something breathable (e.g. a coffee filter) and ferment for 7-14 days at a warm room temp. Taste to determine when it's done.

To bottle, add any flavorings or additions to the bottom of each bottle and siphon/pour the kombucha into each up to the top, leaving a small amount of headspace. Seal with an airtight cap and ferment for 2-7 days while
watching the bubbles in the bottle. Refrigerate when proper carbonation is reached.
