- Mussels, scrubbed clean
- Butter 
- Leek or fennel (optional); shallot or onion; garlic. All thinly sliced.
- Bay and/or other hardy herbs
- Salt and pepper
- Dry white wine
- Crème fraîche or heavy cream (optional)
- Lemon juice and zest; parsley leaves, finely chopped
- *For serving:* Baguette or fries. A thin (i.e. more vinegar) mayonnaise for dipping.


Saute alliums and bay in butter and season. Add wine and reduce the alcohol. Steam the mussels, stirring occasionally, removing them as they finish cooking. Mix in more butter and crème fraîche. Return mussels to the pot and reheat. (Alternatively, keep everything in the pot if not using dairy). Dress in lemon juice, zest, and parsley. 

Serve immediately with toasted bread or fries.
