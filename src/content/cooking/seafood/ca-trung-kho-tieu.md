Vietnamese braised capelin


1. Marinade **capelin** in **fish sauce**, **sugar**, **black pepper**, **scallion whites**, **garlic** and **thai chili** on a plate. Could also add MSG.
2. Melt **yellow rock sugar** in **oil** until you have an even, deep brown layer of caramel. This gives the dish a rich brown color. I do this in a small dutch oven.
3. Add the fish and rest of marinade, and braise. Initially cover it to develop flavor and make the fish release liquid, and then reduce uncovered until saucy.
4. Garnish with **scallion greens**, and serve with rice.

## Notes:
- Can make in a clay pot, or transfer to clay pot for serving.
- More usual to marinade in nước màu instead of melting sugar on the spot. Then,
you can start by frying aromatics.
