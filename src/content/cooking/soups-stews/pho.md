description: Vietnamese noodle soup with a clean, aromatic beef broth base.
---
For the broth (1 stockpot):
- 2 onions; 1 hand of ginger, bruised — All well-charred by flame or broiler and rinsed of blackened bits
- Beef bones (e.g. leg bones), some preferably with marrow
- Meat, in two categories:
    - **Stewed:** Bone-in cuts with lots of connective tissue (e.g. beef shin, oxtail), cooked until tender and served in chunks 
    - **Boiled:** Boneless cuts that shouldn't be overcooked (e.g. chuck, brisket), to be served sliced against the grain
- Spices, whole and toasted. In order of importance:
    - 5 star anise pods
    - 6 cloves
    - 1 stick cinnamon
    - 1 pod black cardamom
    - Coriander seeds
    - Fennel seeds
- Salt; yellow rock sugar (or white sugar); fish sauce; pinch of MSG

For the bowls:
- Rice noodles (fresh), soaked in hot water or parboiled 
- Raw beef (e.g. flank, sirloin), thinly sliced. Easier to slice when very cold
- Meat and tendons from broth
- Any additional meat toppings (e.g. beef meatballs, tripe, etc.)
- White onions; green onions — both thinly sliced
- *On the side:* Bean sprouts, Thai basil, culantro, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, etc.


To purify scum, cover bones (and optionally broth meat) in water and bring to a vigorous boil for a couple minutes. Dump water and rinse bones/meat clean. Simmer all broth ingredients with enough water to submerge for about 5 hours, but take the non-stewing meats out early after 1.5-2 hours and refrigerate covered under cold water to prevent drying out (or wrap in plastic after soaking in water). This meat will not be the most tender; added texture is the goal.

Strain broth. Pick out meat and anything else to serve, including tendons and bones with marrow. Maintain broth at a simmer, season, and reduce/dilute as necessary. 

To serve, place noodles and toppings in a bowl and ladle in very hot broth.

Notes:
- Fennel tends to get stuck in meat crevices. If using, keep spices in a sachet.
- I like to freeze individual portions (without toppings). For one bowl:
    - 480g broth
    - Portioned cooked meat
    - 100-130g noodles, frozen separately
