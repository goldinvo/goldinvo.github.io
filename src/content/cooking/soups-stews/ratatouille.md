grade: E
---
- Diced or chopped vegetables. Keep separate.
    - Summer squash (yellow squash, zucchini); Eggplant. Optionally salted and drained of excess water.
    - Sweet bell peppers (red, yellow)
    - Onion; garlic
- Plenty of olive oil
- Canned crushed tomatoes or simmering tomato sauce. Not too much; just enough so the vegetables are dressed in a thick, rich sauce.
- Salt and pepper; Bouquet garni or dried herbs (e.g. herbes de Provence)

Saute each of the vegetables in olive oil and let steam evaporate as they cool. Alternatively, roast each of the vegetables on separate baking trays, getting good color (cut into larger pieces if doing this). 

Combine everything in a heavy pot and stew, stirring frequently, until melded together and deep in color. Optionally stir in chopped fresh herbs such as parsley. Season to taste. Refrigerates well.
