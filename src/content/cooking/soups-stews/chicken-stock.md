- Chicken parts and scraps, optionally roasted
- Onion; carrot; celery; garlic. Left whole or cut into a couple large pieces.
- Parsley; thyme; bay; peppercorns; etc.
- Salt. *To cheat:* Boullion; gelatin; MSG; etc.

Add everything to a stockpot and cover with water. Simmer for multiple hours, occasionally skimming scum from the surface. Strain and reduce/dilute/season as necessary. Optionally remove fat, either by a fat separator or by skimming after refrigerating.

## Pressure Cooker Method
Cook on high pressure for almost an hour. Allow pressure to release naturally to prevent boiling.
