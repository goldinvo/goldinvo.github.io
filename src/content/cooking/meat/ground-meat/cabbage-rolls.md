description: 'Meat filling wrapped in cabbage leaves, braised in a tomato sauce'
grade: A

To wrap with:
- 1 large head of cabbage, to be softened and picked of large leaves.
For filling:
- Ground pork or a mix of pork and beef. About 1-1.5 lbs for 1 batch.
- Onion, finely chopped and sautéed.
- *Optional:* Rice (my preference), cooked and cooled; egg; breadcrumbs; diced tomato; etc.
- *Seasoning:* Salt; black pepper; paprika; oregano; tomato paste; garlic; etc. May sautée with the onions.
To cook with:
- Stock with tomato paste, or tomato sauce, or even tomato soup

Repeatedly boil cabbage and peel layers of soft, pliable leaves. Continue boiling and peeling in a colander as you go through the layers, dipping fingers into cool water as needed. (Untested: apparently, freezing/thawing or pickling the leaves also work well). Cut off the as much of the thick stem as possible without making the leaf too small. Thinner, larger leaves without holes are better.

Combine all filling ingredients. Cook a small portion to check for consistency/taste and adjust. Place a dollop into the center of a cabbage leaf and wrap like a burrito. Place seam side down into a large pot or baking pan lined with extra cabbage leaves or sauce, if using. 

Add liquid (chicken stock, sauce, or soup) and braise for more than an hour. Cover with tin foil if using a baking dish in the oven. The cabbage should be very tender when done. If the liquid is not yet saucy at this point, separately cook the liquid over the stove (adding stock if necessary), seasoning with tomato paste and reducing to a tomato sauce.
