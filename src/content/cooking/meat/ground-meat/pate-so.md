(aka Pâté chaud) A Vietnamese savory pastry made of puff pastry and a pork
meat filling.


**Filling:** (Pick and choose from the listed ingredients)
- Ground pork or a mixture (try to get lean if you can), maybe some wood ear mushroom
- Minced onion (sweated), garlic
- Salt, sugar, pepper, MSG, pate, fish sauce, cognac, etc.
- Potato starch, corn starch, or bread crumbs (optional), both for texture and reducing moisture

Mix filling well (final result should be somewhat bouncy) and microwave to test
seasonings. I try to avoid too much liquid and fat because it will leak out the bottom when baking.

Cut puff pastry into circles/squares. Place filling, brush edges with egg wash/whites/water and
put second piece on top. Crimp with fork (crimp less or skip for more puff). Brush with egg wash/yolk.
Bake at moderate to moderate-hot heat for about 20-30 minutes until golden-brown.
