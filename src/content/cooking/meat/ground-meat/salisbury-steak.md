- *For the patties:*

    - **Breadcrumbs** or a panade
    - An **egg**
    - **Salt**, **pepper**, **garlic powder**, **onion powder**, **worcestershire sauce**, **etc.**
- *For the gravy:*
    - Sliced **mushrooms**, diced **onion**
    - **Butter**
    - **Flour** or a cornstarch slurry to thicken
    - **Beef stock** or chicken stock
    - **Salt**, **pepper**, **ketchup**, **worcestershire sauce**, etc.
- *Serving suggestion:* Mashed potatoes and green beans, peas, or corn.

Thoroughly mix together the patty mixture, cooking small pieces to season to taste. Form into thick patties / steak shapes, pressing dimples into one side so it doesn't ball up when cooking. 

With oil, brown each side of the patties and then set aside. In the same pan, make the gravy, incorporating the fond: Saute mushrooms, and then onions, until soft and browned. Season. Add the butter and flour and cook until no longer raw, then add stock and simmer until thickened. Season. Return the patties to the pan, dress in the gravy, and reheat. Or, bake in the oven if the patties need more time to cook through. Serve.
