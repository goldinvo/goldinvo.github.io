- Chicken breast, thin-sliced and optionally pounded even. Optionally brined.
- Salt and pepper
- Oil
- *Serving suggestion:* [White Wine Pan Sauce](../../sauces-condiments/white-wine-pan-sauce)

Dry and season chicken breast. Sear the good side well without moving until it releases on its own, and then flip and sear the other side, such that you have good crust/color and the chicken is being cooked through. Let rest briefly, tented with foil if necessary, before serving.

*TODO: Lots of variations possible here*
