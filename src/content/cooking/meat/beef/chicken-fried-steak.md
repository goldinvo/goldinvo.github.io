Tenderized steak breaded and fried like chicken.


1. Use tenderized cube steak, or tenderize and pound flat a flavorful cut. Can pound flour into the meat.
2. Dredge and fry as you would shallow-fried chicken. Either: 
    - Marinade the meat in seasoned buttermilk, then dredge in seasoned flour (add buttermilk to make craggily)
        - Buttermilk (+ 1 egg), flour, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, salt and pepper, etc.
        - May add cornstarch to flour dredge
    - Or, take fresh meat and do a dry-wet-dry dredge.

3. Make a white gravy to top. Either make separately with butter, or use leftover oil from frying
    - 1/4 cup frying oil, flour, milk, salt and pepper.

Serve with mashed potatoes and green beans.
