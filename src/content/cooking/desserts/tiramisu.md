- *For the cream:*
    - 8 oz container of **mascarpone**
    - 80-100g **sugar**, divided
    - 3-4 **egg** yolks, 2-3 whites
- **Espresso** or strong coffee, cooled, with a dash of **rum**/cognac/etc.
- **Ladyfingers** ("savoiardi")
- **Cocoa powder**; bittersweet **chocolate** (opt.)

Whip egg yolks and half of the sugar until light and airy. Add the mascarpone and whip until smooth. In a separate bowl with clean beaters, whip egg whites and remaining sugar to stiff peaks. Gently fold the meringue into the cream.

Quickly dip ladyfingers into espresso and arrange them in a single layer in the serving dish. Spread a layer of cream, and optionally a cocoa dusting. Repeat for another layer. Smooth the top and dust with cocoa powder. Rest in the refrigerator before serving. Optionally top with shaved chocolate.

## Notes

**Using heavy cream:** Replace the egg whites with 3/4 cup of heavy cream, similarly whipping to stiff peaks.
