## Rich and Creamy Pommes Pur√©e 
 - **Yukon gold potatoes**, scrubbed
 - **Butter** (likely at least a stick), cut into pieces
 - **Heavy cream** (plenty, until very smooth), warmed
 - **Salt**; **white pepper** (opt.); **chives** (opt.)

Cover potatoes in cold water and bring to a simmer, cooking until completely tender. Drain and quickly peel. Pass the potatoes through a ricer or food mill, and then optionally through a tamis. Over heat, mix in the butter and whisk in the cream. Season.

***Garlic Potatoes:*** Add **garlic confit** along with the potatoes as they are riced/milled.

## Light and Fluffy
- **Russet potatoes**, peeled and cut into chunks 
- **Butter**; **milk**. Warmed.
- **Salt**, **pepper**

Rinse the potatoes to remove some starch, and then boil until completely tender. Briefly rinse again with hot water and pass through a ricer. Gently incorporate butter, milk, and seasonings.
