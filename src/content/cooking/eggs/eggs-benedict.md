- [Hollandaise](../sauces-condiments/hollandaise)
    - **Egg yolk**, **lemon juice**, **butter**, **salt**, **cayenne**  
- **Eggs**, to poach
- **English muffins**, halved
- **Canadian bacon** or sliced ham; **butter**
- **Salt** and **pepper**; **chives** or parsley

Heat a medium pot of water and make hollandaise. 

Set water to a steady simmer and poach the eggs, gently agitating the water as they come in, and as they cook so the bottom doesn't stick. Drain on a paper towel when whites are set but yolk is still uncooked to the touch. Meanwhile, toast the English muffins, and brown the Canadian bacon on a pan with a bit of butter. 

Assemble the open-faced muffin, Canadian bacon, and egg in a stack. Season. Spoon hollandaise. Garnish and serve.
