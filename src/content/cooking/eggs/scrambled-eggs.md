- Butter
- Eggs; cream or milk (optional); salt
- *Garnish:* Chives, black pepper, parsley, etc.

## French Style
Add eggs and a generous amount of butter to a cold saucier or double boiler. Season. Heat very gently while whisking constantly. Once smooth and custardy, remove from heat and serve, accounting for carryover cooking.

For a fluffier version, use a rubber spatula instead of a whisk, folding more deliberately to form small but distinct curds.

## American Style
Melt butter in a nonstick pan (or a regular pan if hot enough). Use low heat for soft scrambled eggs. 

Add the seasoned, beaten egg mixture (or beat in the pan for distinct yolk and whites) and cook, stirring/folding to get the desired size of curds. Remove from heat just before done and serve.
