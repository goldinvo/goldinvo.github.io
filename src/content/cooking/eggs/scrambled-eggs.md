- **Butter**
- **Eggs**; **cream** or milk (optional); **salt**
- *Garnish:* **Chives, black pepper, parsley, etc.**

## Rich and Creamy Method
Add eggs and a generous amount of butter to a cold saucier or double boiler. Season. Heat very gently while whisking constantly. Once smooth and custardy, remove from heat and serve, accounting for carryover cooking.

For a fluffier version, use a rubber spatula instead of a whisk, folding more deliberately to form small but distinct curds.

## Light and Fluffy Method
Melt butter in a nonstick or a hot carbon steel pan. Use low heat for soft scrambled eggs. 

Add the seasoned, beaten egg mixture (or beat in the pan for distinct yolk and whites) and cook, stirring/folding to get the desired size of curds. Remove from heat just before done and serve.
