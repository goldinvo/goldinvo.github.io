- 3 Eggs; cream or milk (opt.); chopped herbs (opt.); salt
- Butter (be generous)
- *Filling suggestions:* Cheese, smoked salmon, mushrooms, etc.

Whisk eggs, cream, and herbs very well. Season.

Melt butter on medium to medium-high heat. Once foaming subsides (but before the butter browns), add the egg mixture and rapidly stir to break it into small curds, while continuously shaking the pan to fill any gaps. Just before the egg is set, lower/kill the heat, place any fillings if desired, and rest for a beat. Roll from the edge of the pan, and before the last roll, hold the pan and hit the handle so the omelette falls into the crook of the pan and can be flipped onto its seam on the plate.

Optionally brush with butter for a glossy finish. Season/garnish if desired.

Large fillings may be added at the end by filling a seam cut in the center
of the final omelette.

Notes:

This can be done in a very well seasoned carbon steel pan with a good bit of finesse. Alternatively, use a non-stick pan, which, if desired, also affords you to use lower heat to get a more even texture throughout.
