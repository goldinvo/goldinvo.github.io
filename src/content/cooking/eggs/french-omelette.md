A blonde, rolled omelette with a soft (but not runny!) interior.


Whisk 3 eggs, optionally with a splash of cream/milk and/or chopped herbs, and season.
Melt a generous amount of butter on medium to medium-high until foaming subsides. 
Add eggs and vigorously whisk/shake pan with plastic chopsticks until just before
set, barely filling in any final gaps. Lower heat, place any desired fillings (cheese, smoked salmon), 
and rest for a beat. Roll in thirds or so as you plate.

Heartier fillings may be added at the end by filling a seam cut in the center
of the final omelette.
