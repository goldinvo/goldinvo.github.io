These are the very first projects I made when I first started getting into fiber arts! The blue and red ones are made in [waffle stitch](https://www.fiberfluxblog.com/2016/10/free-crochet-patternwaffle-stitch.html){:target="_blank"} with attached crochet flowers. The big flowers are roses made using a rolled strip of crochet fabric. I found these to be much too bulky for a scarf, and in hindsight, I would exclusively use the smaller flowers found on the red scarf instead. The white scarf is made using a gradient yarn that has relatively sharp color changes, which in my opinion makes a beautiful color contrast when worn.    

A fringe is added to all of the scarves by looping bundles of yarn onto the ends with lark's head knots using a thick crochet hook.
