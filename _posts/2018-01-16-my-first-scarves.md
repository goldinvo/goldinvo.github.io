These are the very first projects I made when I first started getting into fiber arts! The blue and red ones https://www.fiberfluxblog.com/2016/10/free-crochet-patternwaffle-stitch.html are made in waffle stitch with rose appliques. The big roses are made using a rolled crochet strip. I think these are too bulky, and in the future would opt for using more of the flat smaller flowers on the red scarf. The white scarf is made with alternating rows of made with a gradient yarn with relatively sharp color changes that I think make for excellent color contrast when worn. Attatched are tassels made with groups of yarn hooked onto the ends with lark's knots.
