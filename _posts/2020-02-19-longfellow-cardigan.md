A simple stockinette cardigan. For this projet I used Brooklyn Tweed's recommended Loft yarn in Homemade Jam. This was my first time working with a lovely woolen spun yarn. I'm not an expert on fibers, but from a novices perspective I love how "wooly" this yarn is. At first it seemed a little fragile and thin, but after working with it I've learned that its woolen spin amplifies the resiliency of wool fiber and how it slightly mattes together to create a plush, cozy, and durable texture. If it weren't for how hot it gets here in the south (I find little use for the clothes that this type of yarn would be used for), this would be one of my favorite yarns to use.
