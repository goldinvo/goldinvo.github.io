Another simple scarf. I used the same weight yarns (doubled fingering and no.10 crochet cotton) as [the last scarf I made]({% post_url 2020-06-15-first-table-loom-scarf %}), but this time I wanted to see what would happen if I emphansized the color of the weft threads instead. I think it created a really nice texture, and I think that some really cool gradients can be made by varying how tightly you pack the weft thread (you can see I did this by accident towards the ends).
