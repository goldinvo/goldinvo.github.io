These are some motifs that I made for use in [Irish crochet lace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_crochet_lace){:target="_blank"} projects. All of the patterns, with the exception of the largest flower in the third image, can be found in [Kathryn White's "The Go-To Book for Irish Crochet Motifs](https://www.amazon.com/Go-Book-Irish-Crochet-Motifs/dp/1596359234){:target="_blank"}. Overall, I found the patterns in this book to be well-written and produce appealing designs.

I love making Irish crochet motifs because they are small and can be made while I'm out and about. They also look impressive as individual pieces, and completing each motif feels like completing an individual project. After making enough motifs, they can be meshed together into a lovely Irish crochet lace piece.
