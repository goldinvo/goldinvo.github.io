My first go-around with tatting. I made quite a few mistakes in this one (see if you can spot the loop that I skipped!) but overall I'm satisfied with the result. I used a regular tatted bookmark pattern and attached a tassel with a crochet chain. The tassel was really fun to make---check YouTube for instructions---and I'll be looking for excuses to add them onto more of my projects.
