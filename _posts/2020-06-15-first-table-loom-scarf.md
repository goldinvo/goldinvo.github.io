A simple scarf to get familiar with my new table loom. I used [Ashford's SampleIt loom video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0aFlG7294w){:target="_blank"} as a reference, though I would advise against the edging that you get by finishing off with knotting the warp threads. In a later project, I found that hemstitching the edge produced a much nicer result.
