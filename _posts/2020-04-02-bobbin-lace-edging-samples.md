A few sample trims from my foray into bobbin lacemaking. All of these patterns are sequential lessons from the book [Lessons in Bobbin Lacemaking](https://books.google.com/books/about/Lessons_in_Bobbin_Lacemaking.html?id=ZH2GwtfD5BUC){:target="_blank"} by Doris Southard. I'm about halfway through, and can't imagine a better resource than this one. The lessons that are easy to follow and the pacing/ordering of lessons is very well thought out. I'm so excited to get to the section with doilies.

The book focuses a lot on lace edgings, which I imagine are popular with people who like to sew. For my purposes though, I made some adaptations to focus on getting through the basics and on to the good stuff: For the lace pillow, instead of a roller, I used a flat piece of styrofoam and later a cookie pillow. The edgings are thus short but enough to learn from. For the pattern cards, instead of pricked cardstock, I just copied the patterns in the book on tracing paper and "laminated" them in clear tape, which was good enough for a single sample. Copying directly from the book is good for no. 30 DMC cotton in my experience.
