adapted from one of the butterflies on this doily https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/butterfly-night-table-doily-s-55

crochet around a wire along the perimeter. different edging (sc's with picots) because need to stuff as many sc's as you can to cover the wire. simple oval and attannae attatched. beads also added along perimeter thoguh i wish i didnt add them. Allows the butterfly to be free-standing and moldable without the use of starch. I think the result is preferable to starch. more friendly to the touch.
